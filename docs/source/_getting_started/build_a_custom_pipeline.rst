How to Build a Custom Oligo Design Pipeline
===========================================

The Oligo Designer Toolsuite is a collection of modules providing core functionalities 
for custom oligo design pipelines within a flexible Python framework. 
All modules share a common runtime- and memory-optimized data structure 
and a standardized API, which allows users to combine them flexibly based on their 
required processing steps.

This section demonstrates how to use the Oligo Designer Toolsuite to develop 
a custom oligo design pipeline.
