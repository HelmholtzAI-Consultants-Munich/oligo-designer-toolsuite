# Oligo Hybridization Probability Filter Class
############################################


class HybridizationProbabilityFilter(SpecificityFilterReference):
    """
    A filter for assessing hybridization probabilities of oligonucleotides using AI models.

    The `HybridizationProbabilityFilter` class evaluates the likelihood of hybridization between oligonucleotides and potential off-target sequences based on a threshold.
    It utilizes an AI model to predict hybridization probabilities and filters out oligonucleotides that exceed the specified threshold.

    To define the hybridization probability we consider an experiment where the oligo sequence, the on-target site, and the off-target site are introduced with the
    same concentration. Next, the hybridization probability is the ratio of the final concentration of the DNA complex composed of the oligo and the off-target site,
    and all the DNA complexes that contain the oligo (oligo + off-target and oligo + on-target):

    $$C_{oligo + off-t} /C_{oligo + off-t} + C_{oligo + on-t}$$.

    In simpler terms, the hybridization probability is the frequency with which the oligo binds to the off-target site, compared to the number of successful bindings of the oligo.
